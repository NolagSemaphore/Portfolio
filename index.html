    <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm James Wilson — a seasoned backend-focused software developer with over 15 years of professional experience in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and SQL-based systems. I hold a <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Science</strong> with a minor in Applied Mathematics from <strong>Florida State University</strong> in Tallahassee, Florida.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve lived and worked in several cities across the U.S., with each move opening the door to new challenges and perspectives. Many of my roles have been project-based or aligned with relocation — experiences that helped me build a broad foundation across tech stacks, industries, and team environments.</p>

    <p>From fintech and government systems to logistics and public sector applications, I’ve contributed to the modernization of legacy systems and the development of scalable microservices. I enjoy solving tough backend problems, collaborating with thoughtful teams, and delivering software that balances structure with clarity.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I spend time on personal projects like <a href="https://www.chordela.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chordela</a>, exploring music, playing chess and staying curious about how systems — technical or otherwise — fit together.</p>
